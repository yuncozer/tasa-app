name: Blue Professional — Frame (video / frame layer)
description: >
  Video-first companion to Blue Professional's design.md. The unit is the frame (1920×1080). Atoms
  are identical and sacred — the warm cream canvas, a single saturated cobalt (#1e2bfa) as the only
  accent, the three-step gray text ladder, Geist Sans (display/numerals/chrome) + Geist Sans (body),
  soft cobalt-tinted cards (4% fill / 20% border / 10–14px radius) with NO shadows, pill chrome, and
  the cobalt progress bar. Composition + frame scale rewritten. Motion out of scope.
unit: the frame — 1920×1080 primary; 9:16 and 1:1 documented

# Blue Professional — Frame (video / frame layer)

## Brand adaptation (READ FIRST — the frontmatter is the source of truth)

This is the **blue-professional** preset remixed onto the captured brand. The YAML frontmatter above (colors · typography · components) is **normative and already correct — use it verbatim.** The prose below is the ORIGINAL preset's intent; read it THROUGH the frontmatter:

- **Fonts** — Geist Sans, display AND body. It is the ONLY family in this video. Ignore every
  other font name in the prose below (Space Grotesk, Inter, Noto). There is no mono face: numbers
  align with `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`, never by switching family.
- **Colors** — use the frontmatter hex ONLY. The palette is nine locked tokens from the project's
  `ESTILOS.md`; no color outside them may appear anywhere in the video.
- **THE THEME IS DARK AND FIXED — this inverts the preset.** Where the prose says "warm cream
  canvas" / "cream ground", read **`bg` #0b1120**, a near-black navy. Where it says "near-black
  headings", read **`text` #f1f5f9**, near-white. There is no light variant and no
  `prefers-color-scheme`.
- **Where the prose says "cobalt", read `primary` #34d399** — a green. It is the single accent and
  carries the brand mark, the calculator result, the brecha figure, and the CTA. No second accent.
- **Cards are SOLID, not tinted.** Where the prose says "4% cobalt card fill", read `card-bg`
  #131c2f — an opaque surface. A control raised *on top of* a surface (a keypad key) uses
  `card-raised` #1b273f. The accent tints (`accent-light` / `accent-medium`) survive only for the
  one highlighted result block and the tag pill.
- **Every border is 1px solid `border` #26324c** — not 1.5px, not a tinted accent border, never
  thicker. Contrast comes from the fill, not the stroke.
- **`warning` #fbbf24 is SEMANTIC, never decorative.** It means "this number is not trustworthy
  right now". Nothing in this video is untrustworthy, so **it must not appear at all**. `positive`
  and `negative` are likewise unused — the video shows no directional change chips.
- **No shadows anywhere**, including the CTA. The preset's one hover shadow is removed.


## Overview

Blue Professional at frame scale is a **consulting-grade system: restraint with one strong
commitment.** A warm cream canvas and a single saturated cobalt that carries every accent —
eyebrow, metric, CTA, chart fill, progress bar. No secondary brand color, no pastels, just cream,
cobalt, and a tight ladder of grays. The register is investment-research / McKinsey briefing:
measured, data-dense without crowding, executive-readable at distance.

The voice is two faces in fixed roles: **Geist Sans** (display, every numeral, all chrome —
eyebrows uppercase 0.08em) and **Geist Sans** (body, muted gray, line 1.6). Headlines are near-black;
cobalt is reserved for accent moments. Depth is **soft and tinted** — 4% cobalt card fills with 20%
cobalt borders and 10–14px radii — never shadowed. The lack of harsh shadows is the premium signal.

**Key characteristics at frame scale:**

- **Warm cream ground** on every frame; **single cobalt** as the only accent.
- **Geist Sans** (display/numerals/chrome) + **Geist Sans** (body) — near-black headlines, cobalt numerals.
- **Tinted cards** — cobalt 4% fill, cobalt 20% 1.5px border, 10–14px radius, **no shadow**.
- **Pill chrome** (100px) — tag pills + the one solid cobalt CTA; cobalt **progress bar**.
- **Soft rounded corners everywhere** (no square corners save the progress bar).
- **Atmosphere** (diagonal panel, dot grid, concentric rings) on cover/closing only.

## The Frame

### Frame Craft Bar

Three eyeball tests gate every frame before any structural check:

- **Squint** — one **near-black headline or cobalt numeral** dominates at 3–6× its neighbor.
- **Silence** — content frames read **balanced, not crowded**; the **dashboard is the one dense exception**.
- **Restraint** — a **single cobalt accent** carries everything; headlines stay near-black (never cobalt); no shadows (tinted cards do the lift); positive/negative inline-text only.
- **Reference** — aim at an **investment-research / McKinsey quarterly briefing**; failure looks like a **heavy-outlined, multi-color dashboard**.

- **Primary:** 1920×1080 (16:9). Display authored in **`cqw`** (`px ÷ 1920 × 100 = cqw`).
- **Vertical:** 1080×1920 (9:16). **Square:** 1080×1080 (1:1).
- **Safe area:** `pad-x` 5cqw; bottom reserves room for the counter + progress bar.

**The container law (load-bearing).** Every frame ground sets `container-type: size`; ALL
frame-relative units are `cqw`/`cqh` against it — never `vw`. Card radii stay px (10–14px); the
pill radius stays 100px; borders stay 1–1.5px.

## Colors

Tokens identical to the source. `{colors.bg}` cream is the universal ground; `{colors.primary}`
cobalt is the **only** accent — every eyebrow, numeral, CTA, chart fill, progress bar, and the 4px
highlight left-rule. Headlines are `{colors.text}` near-black (never cobalt); body is
`{colors.text-muted}`; tertiary is `{colors.text-light}`. Cards fill `{colors.card-bg}` (4%) with
`{colors.border}` (20%) borders. `{colors.positive}`/`{colors.negative}` appear **only inline** on
directional change chips — never as fills. **No second accent color.**

## Typography

Two ramps. The **reading ramp** (Geist Sans body 0.85cqw muted; Geist Sans eyebrow uppercase 0.08em
cobalt) carries copy + chrome; the **display/numerical ramp** (Geist Sans `h3` 1.25cqw → `h1`
4.2cqw near-black; numerals `stat-num`/`metric-value` in cobalt) carries headings and figures.

- **Legibility floor:** any load-bearing line ≥ **1.4cqw**; px chrome (tag/counter) is colophon only.
- **Fit-to-measure:** size the headline to its length. Cap the block at **≤ 78cqw**; ≤3 words → `h1`; 4–6 → `h2`; 7+ → `h3`. Cobalt numerals scale `metric-value`→`stat-num` by card size.
- **Headlines near-black, −0.02em**; **eyebrows cobalt, uppercase, 0.08em**; **numerals cobalt 600–700**; **body Geist Sans 400 muted, line 1.6**. No italic, no uppercase body, no cobalt headline.

## Depth & Surface

Soft and tinted — never offset. Depth from:

- **Tinted cards** — 4% cobalt fill + 20% cobalt 1.5px border + 10–14px radius reads as lifted without offset.
- **Border-left accent** — the 4px cobalt rule on split-highlight blocks pulls a callout forward.
- **Rounded corners** — the 10–14px radius is part of the softness; square corners break it.

**Ceiling:** zero box-shadow on content (the only shadow is a soft cobalt CTA _hover_); no opaque cobalt borders; no harsh outlines.

## Shapes

- **100px** — tag pills, CTA, nav buttons (pill chrome).
- **14/12/10px** — cards by size (large metric / standard stat / detail + mini).
- **6px** — bar tracks + fills. **50%** — step circles, nav circles, dots, closing rings.
- **0** — only the progress bar. No square-cornered content.

## Components

- **card-tinted / metric-card** — the universal soft-tint content cards (no shadow).
- **tag-pill / cta-button / accent-line** — the cobalt pill chrome + the one solid CTA + the 60×4 rule.
- **bar-track / step-circle / split-highlight** — cobalt data + sequence + callout patterns.
- **slide-header** (eyebrow + tag pill) — the structural rhythm; **atmosphere** (diagonal/dots/rings) on cover/closing only; **progress-bar** on every frame.

## Frame Treatments

> Recipe: ground · container · composes · focal · chrome · accent · silence · Fixed/Free · density.
> Atmosphere only on cover/closing; content frames carry the slide-header rhythm.

### 1 · Cover (identity · move: diagonal accent · left)

**Ground** cream + the clipped diagonal cobalt-tint panel (right ~36%) + a 3×3 cobalt dot grid.
**Composes** accent-line, meta, h1, body sub. **Focal** a 2-line Geist Sans `h1` near-black, left,
under a cobalt accent-line + meta. **Chrome** counter + progress bar. **Accent** the cobalt line +
diagonal panel. **Silence** the diagonal panel holds the right third. **Fixed** near-black h1, cobalt
accents, atmosphere here only. **Free** title, meta. **Density** low.

### 2 · Dashboard (data · move: 3-up metric grid · the dense frame)

**Ground** cream, `pad-x`. **Composes** slide-header (eyebrow + tag-pill), h2, 3× metric/tinted card.
**Focal** a row of tinted cards — cobalt `metric-value` + Geist Sans label + muted desc + optional
green/red change chip. **Chrome** eyebrow left, tag-pill right; progress bar. **Accent** the cobalt
numerals. **Silence** tight — the density exception. **Fixed** 4% tint cards, 20% borders, no shadow,
cobalt numerals. **Free** figures (from script), labels. **Density** dense-exception.

### 3 · Bar Ranking (data · move: cobalt bars · left)

**Ground** cream, `pad-x`. **Composes** eyebrow, h2, bar-track rows. **Focal** 3–5 labeled
cobalt-fill bars on cobalt-8% tracks with cobalt percentages. **Chrome** eyebrow; progress bar.
**Accent** the cobalt fills + figures. **Silence** moderate. **Fixed** 6px tracks, cobalt fills.
**Free** rows, values (from script). **Density** standard.

### 4 · Pull Quote (quote · move: concentric rings · centered)

**Ground** cream, centered, with faint concentric closing-rings behind. **Composes** quote-mark,
blockquote, cite. **Focal** a Geist Sans `blockquote` near-black under a 15%-opacity cobalt
quote-mark; an uppercase cobalt-muted cite beneath. **Accent** the faint rings + quote-mark. **Silence**
~55%. **Fixed** near-black quote, soft rings. **Free** quote, cite. **Density** low.

### 5 · Split + Highlight (content · move: asymmetric split · left)

**Ground** cream, two columns. **Composes** eyebrow, h2, body, split-highlight block. **Focal** an
Geist Sans body column beside a cobalt-8% highlight block (4px cobalt left rule) carrying an inline pull
quote. **Accent** the highlight's left rule. **Silence** generous gutter. **Fixed** tinted highlight,
4px cobalt rule. **Free** body, callout. **Density** standard.

### 6 · Closing / CTA (closer · move: centered rings + CTA)

**Ground** cream + concentric closing-rings. **Composes** accent-line, h1, body, cta-button. **Focal**
a Geist Sans `h1` near-black, centered, with the one solid cobalt `cta-button` pill below. **Accent**
the CTA + rings. **Silence** ~60%. **Fixed** one CTA, near-black h1, soft rings. **Free** sign-off, CTA
label. **Density** low.

## Composition Rules

### Do

- Start every frame on **warm cream**; let **cobalt carry every accent** (eyebrow, numeral, CTA, bar, progress).
- Set headlines **near-black, −0.02em**; eyebrows **cobalt uppercase 0.08em**; numerals **cobalt 600–700**.
- Use **tinted cards** (4% fill, 20% border, 10–14px radius, no shadow); body Geist Sans 400 muted, line 1.6.
- Keep all chrome **pill-shaped (100px)**; one solid cobalt CTA per closing frame.
- Reserve **atmosphere** (diagonal panel, dots, rings) for cover/closing; content frames keep the slide-header rhythm.
- Lean left on cover/dashboard/split, centered on quote/closer.

### Don't

- No second accent color; no cobalt headlines.
- No drop shadows on content (only the soft cobalt CTA hover); no opaque cobalt borders.
- No square corners (save the progress bar); no font substitutes; no uppercase body.
- Don't use the green/red change chips as general accents — directional comparisons only.
- Don't fill space with heavier borders — add substance; don't blow a headline edge-to-edge.

## Aspect-Ratio Behavior

| Treatment         | 16:9                       | 9:16                           | 1:1                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Cover             | title left, diagonal right | title top, diagonal band below | title upper, dots corner |
| Dashboard         | 3 cards across             | 3 stacked                      | 2×2                      |
| Bar Ranking       | 3–5 bars                   | 3–5 bars (tighter)             | 3 bars                   |
| Pull Quote        | centered, rings behind     | centered, taller               | centered                 |
| Split + Highlight | side-by-side               | stacked                        | stacked                  |
| Closing / CTA     | centered + CTA             | centered + CTA                 | centered + CTA           |

`pad-x` holds on the short edge; re-step display above the 1.4cqw floor. The diagonal cover panel
becomes a top/bottom band on 9:16. Numerals stay Latin Arabic digits in CJK builds.

## Approved Entities

No real customers, logos, or vendors are defined in the source — render any such mark as a
placeholder. Figures, metrics, and quotes are content; the system supplies cream + cobalt + grays.

## Numerals & Claims (hard rule)

Never invent figures, financials, percentages, or dates at frame scale. Render slots as `— figure —`,
`{metric}`, `+NN%`, `↑ —`. Metric cards, bar values, and stat cells especially carry placeholders
until the script supplies them. Directional chips require a real comparison from the script.

## Pre-Render Self-Audit

- **Squint** — one near-black headline or cobalt numeral dominates per frame.
- **Silence** — content frames balanced, not crowded; only the dashboard runs dense.
- **Single accent** — cobalt only; headlines near-black; positive/negative inline only.
- **Type** — Geist Sans headings −0.02em near-black, cobalt eyebrows 0.08em + numerals; Geist Sans body muted line 1.6; ≥1.4cqw floor.
- **Depth** — tinted cards (no shadow), soft rounded corners, 20% cobalt borders; no square content corners.
- **Anchor** — left on cover/dashboard/split, centered on quote/closer; atmosphere on cover/closing only.
- **Fabrication** — every numeral traces to the script, else placeholder.

## Known Gaps

- **Motion intentionally out of scope.** frame.md specifies composition only; the source's 500ms translateX transitions + bar-fill animations are deck mechanics.
- **Geist Sans + Geist Sans via Google Fonts.** CJK pairing (Noto Sans SC 700 display / Noto Serif SC 400 body) carries over; the eyebrow's uppercase+tracking signal weakens in CJK — pair it with the accent-line.
- **9:16 / 1:1 are guidance**; verify the floor and that the diagonal panel reflows to a band.
- Diagonal panel (clip-path), dot grid, concentric rings, and bars are CSS-only; no external imagery is required.
